Trigger, Class, Custom setting implementing rollup count of attachments on any object. 
Also, it will rollup the max date value of CreateDate of all attachments (most recent
attachment). 

Core Project Contents: 
AttachmentRollupTrigger.cls
AttachmentRollupException.cls

AttachmentRollupTrigger.trigger
csRollupObj__c.object

Test Object - can be replaced by an actual object in installed org
Attachment_Rollup_Tester__c.object
Attachment_Rollup_Tester__c-Attachment Rollup Tester Layout.layout

Once installed, add two fields to any object that supports attachments. One field 
should be Number data type. The other Date/Time. 

csRollupObj__c is a custom setting. For each object that you want to have the rollup
count, add a custom setting record. 
	Name: sObject prefix. Examples - Account: 001 | Case: 500 | etc.
	sObject: sObject API Name. Originally intended for dynamic Apex/SOQL...
		 	 but not actually used. 
	Count_Field__c: The number field. Tests assume Integer, so best as 0 decimal places
	Max_Date_Field__c: The Date/Time field. Optional.

And that should do it.
